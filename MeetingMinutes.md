# Minutes for Meeting 3 (28/08/2021)

## Agenda:

* Discussed work done since last meeting.
* Mark pulled Twitter data and created plots using R script.
* Jingxin created plots for Olympic Data using software.
* Linyuan created Jupyter script to plot data, created geomap showing cumulative medals won for countries.

* Decided the project will be on Summer Olympic medal data from inception to present + world facts data.
* Scope:
  * By using data from Summer Olympics since 1930's, see which factors result in a country winning medals
  * Create model using Summer Olympics data, and further test accuracy/optimise for Winter Olympics data
* Possible contributing factors:
  * Hemisphere country is located in
  * Season in home country when games are held
  * Favourite sport in that country (might need additional survey)
  * Consider different sports in each Olympics

## Actions: 

* Linyuan: 
  * Look at making GIF (doesn't have to be by pitch due date)
  * Upload jupyter/R export file to GitHub
  * Create GDP vs population / number of athletes plot
* Jingxin
  * Explore different attributes and their impact on medal tally etc.
* Mark / Tim:
  * Start working on PowerPoint, will sort out recording of presentation

# Minutes for Meeting 2 (23/08/2021)

## Agenda:
* Discussed various options for data science project:
1.	__Dataset from Kaggle for Olympic medallists since ~1930s__
 * Various attributes:
   * Name of winner, type of medal won, date won
   * Location and year of Olympic games, winter/summer
   * Sport, country represented
   * Could potentially look at seeing trends between winner and country GDP, or whether hosting Olympics significantly effects chances of winning a medal
2.	__Twitter ID dataset (1 billion Twitter IDs) from hashtags related to COVID-19 since March 2020 until present__
   * Data will need to be refreshed/downloaded from Twitter site due to terms of use (cannot share Tweets on public domains, only Twitter IDs)
   * Data cleaning will need to be done - but has been done by multiple others already (can we use their source code?)
   * Possible scope:
   * Sentiment polarity is impacted by trend of COVID-19 cases in the country the Tweet was made from
   * Sentiment polarity is impacted by stringency of lockdowns in the country COVID-19: Stringency Index (ourworldindata.org)
   * Sentiment polarity on vaccines compared to COVID-19 vaccine take-up (predict future vaccine hesitancy?)
   * Alter the hashtags looked at to include Australia-specific terms (e.g. #ScoMo, #Antilockdownprotest, #Auspol)
3.	__Electric cars__
   * Information about the cost of electric cars

* Concerns raised about Option 2 being too large in scope

## Actions: 
Tim:
  * Handle recording of 2-minute pitch due on 03/09/2021
  * Possibly create a few slides relating to this
  * Create Github for the group

Mark:
  * Assist with scoping out project and slides
  * Download raw data for Option 2 and upload to Github to see viability
  * Create minutes and post it to Github

Jingxin and Linyuan:
  * Have a look at the data and do initial exploratory data analysis
  * Create 1-2 plots showing initial exploration

__Next meeting Friday 27/08/2021 at 12:00pm AEST__
